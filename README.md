In this video tutorial series we are going to cover one of my favourite, and most immediately useful components on offer - Symfony's Workflow Component.

Before going further I want to say a huge thank you to [Grégoire Pineau][1], and of course, [Fabien Potencier][2], along with all the others involved in getting the Workflow Component added to Symfony in 3.2.

The Workflow Component introduces a few new pieces of terminology:

* Workflows and State Machines
* Definitions
* Places
* Transitions
* The Marking Store

Amongst others.

As ever when learning about a new piece of Symfony, my personal preference is to first see the concept in action which gives a basis to relate back to in future learning.

With that in mind, we will start by reviewing [the amazing demo application][4] created by Grégoire Pineau for his reveal of the Workflow Component at Symfony Live Paris 2016. You can [find the code here][3].

This application visually demonstrates both the Workflow, and the State Machine workflow types.

From here we will dive further into both workflow types in individual projects.

I hope that during watching these videos you start to imagine the many places in both current - and potential future - projects where the Workflow Component could add both structure, and value to your code.

And after watching the videos I truly hope that you feel a sense of confidence in using this component, understanding the terminology, and when, where, and how you can add this component to your projects.
